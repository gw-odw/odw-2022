    "#### Parameter Estimation: Rejection Sampling\n",

The idea is that to draw samples from a target distribution $p(\\theta | d, M_s)$ which is difficult to sample from, we first generate samples from a generating distribution $g(\\theta$ which is easy to sample from and then weight the samples relative to the target distribution. In practise you can choose any generating distribution you like, but we will use $g(\\theta) = g(f)g(\\alpha)$ where\n",

    "1. Draw $\\theta'=[f, \\alpha]$ from $g(f)$ and $g(\\alpha)$\n",
    "2. Calculate the probability under the target and generating distributions (i.e. $p(\\theta' | d, M_s)$ and $g(\\theta')$)\n",
    "3. Calculate the weight $w=p(\\theta' | d, M_s) / g(\\theta')$\n",
    "4. Draw a random number $u$ uniformly in $[0, 1]$\n",
    "5. If $w > u$, append $\\theta'$ to a set of samples, otherwise reject it and repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue this loop until an acceptable number of samples have been drawn. The resulting set of samples are then an approximation to $p(\\theta | d, M_s)$ and be used to produce summary statistics or create plots. \n",

    "We now program the algoritm for our test data. However, there are ttwo important differnce between this algorithm and the expression above:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will work with the unnormalised distribution $p(\\theta | d, M_s)$ (i.e. we don't calculate the evidence $\\mathcal{Z}$. As a result, $w$ is also unnormalised and so it needs to be normalised before we apply step 5. Fortunately, we can normalize $w$ once we have a distribution of values.  \n",
    "2. For computational efficiency, rather than using a while loop we will instead draw a set of 100000 samples, calculate the weights for each, and then apply rejection sampling. This utilises numpy array optimization and also enables us to normalise the weights to a distribution."

Draw 100 samples from the posterior and overplot them alongside your mean estimate.
