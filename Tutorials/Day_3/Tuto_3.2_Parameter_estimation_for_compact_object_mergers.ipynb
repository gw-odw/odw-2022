Rerun the analysis above but change the prior on the distance from a delta function to `bilby.core.prior.PowerLaw(alpha=2., minimum=50., maximum=800., name='luminosity_distance')`. You should also replace `sample='unif'` with `sample=\"rwalk\", nact=1, walks=1` in your call to `bilby.run_sampler` above. This will take a bit longer than the original run, around ~20 minutes. You also need to change the `label` in the call to `run_sampler` to avoid over-writing your results.\n",

    "What is the median reported value of the distance posterior? What is the new log Bayes factor for signal vs. Gaussian noise? Don't be alarmed if your results do not match the official LVC results, as these are not rigorous settings."
